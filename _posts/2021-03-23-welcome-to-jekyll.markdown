# Hello Internet. 

My name is Dan Crosson, and this is my personal website.

# Why did I make this?

I created this website to display my work and share things about me. I got off of social media this summer, so I need somewhere to do that. 

# Who Am I?

I'm Dan, a computer science graduate student at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I love to learn, and I love to laugh. You can read more about me on the "About" page!

Thanks for visiting my website!
