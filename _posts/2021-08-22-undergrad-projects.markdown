# Undergrad Courses

Below you will find descriptions of selected courses from my undergraduate work at Georgetown University where I majored in Computer Science and Economics.

## Computer Science

### Artificial Intelligence

In this course, I learned fundamental techniques of Artificial Intelligence. The course provided an overview of different areas of AI. In projects, I implemented A*, Bayesian Networks, Resolution Proving, Rule-learning, and Q-learning using Java. In addition to gaining an understanding of AI, we also participated in workshops about the intersection of AI and ethics in cooperation with the Philosophy department. During these workshops, we discussed how AI is implemented in the real world and the ethical questions we might encounter in industry when implementing AI.

### Databases -- University College Dublin

While studying abroad in Ireland, I took a course on database fundamentals. In this course, we learned the theory behind relational databases and how to apply these fundamental concepts to design relational databases properly. We learned how to create schemas with primary and foreign keys and how to represent one-to-many and many-to-many relations. We also learned how to describe these designs with E-R diagrams.


### Advanced Programming

In this course we used Java to learn fundamental concepts in application development like event-driven programming, interfacing with a GUI, and concurrency through hands-on projects and assignments. We also reviewed inheritance, exception handling, and regular expressions.

### Computer Hardware, Computer Systems, Operating Systems

In this three course sequence, we learned about how computers work under the hood from the transistor level to the operating system level. In the hardware course, we created circuits ourselves in the lab that built up to executing branch instructions and I/O interrupts. In the systems course, we continued to abstract away from the transistor level. We implemented projects in binary and assembly to gain an understanding of how machine code interacts with the hardware we built in the hardware course. Finally, in the operating systems course, we learned about how an operating systems manages the computer's resources to create an interface between the application and the hardware. We implemented our projects in C, and they included a file system emulator and a basic shell.

## Economics

### Econometrics -- University College Dublin

In this course, we learned about how to apply regression to conduct economic analysis. We covered the theory and practice of concepts like multiple regression, nonlinear regression, Instrumental variable regression, and determining causation. We used Stata to apply regression analysis to different datasets. 

### Topics in Competition and Regulation

In this course, we reviewed the economic theory behind antitrust policies and applicable U.S. laws from the former chief economist of the Antitrust division at DOJ. We also did case studies of famous antitrust cases. Our semester long project was a mock trial for an assigned antitrust case. As part of this assignment, my trial team and I reviewed relevant case files and developed arguments and questions to support our case, which we presented to class during the mock trial.
